## `injector_linux.cpp` and `injector_win.cpp` - C++ Code Injector
Code injection can be useful in a few legal activities, such as:
- Debugging and troubleshooting: Code injection can be used to debug and troubleshoot your running processes by injecting code to collect information about the state of the program or to modify its behavior to diagnose and fix issues.
- Automated testing: To automate testing by injecting code into your running process to simulate user inputs and interactions, and to verify that the program behaves correctly.
- Security research: To identify and exploit vulnerabilities in your own software by injecting code to test for weaknesses and to demonstrate how they can be exploited.
- Memory management: To manipulate the memory of your running process to optimize the use of system resources and to improve performance.

In this repository you will find code injector for both Windows and Linux
